                    <span>Hi there!</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a Senior Front-end Architect at a global financial company and an Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina.

                <p>
                    Web Development is my life long passion, working on professional projects as early as 13 years old (1996). Please check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabionolasco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> page.

                    During the day I spend my time coordinating front-end Projects, conducting research and POCs on the latest technologies, defining standards for our Front-end Shop, providing technical solutions and recommendations, giving training and workshops, and assisting individual front-end developers in various challenges. At night, I have the opportunity to teach "Software Architecture and Design" to the undergrads and "System Integration"
                    to the graduate students at UNCC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The combination of my involvement with real world challenges, practical hands-on coding, and a strong theoretical foundation, has brought me valuable insights on how to increase the quality of front-end products and the efficiency of their development in a way that is meaningful to organizations and to final users. I am excited to share these constant insights to help the front-end community through books, workshops, lectures, video courses, and blog posts.
